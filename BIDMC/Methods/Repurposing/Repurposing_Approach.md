### Scrounging, Repurposing

First a word about scrounging and repurposing. There are lots of swabs used for various things floating around hospitals, outpatient clinics, private practices, and so on. **Be creative and ask everyone you know. That's what we've been doing and it's gotten us thousands of swabs.** This is a stopgap at best, but every swab counts.

Will a repurposed swab work? Find someone who uses NP swabs, take pictures of what you find, and ask that person to weigh in on suitability. (We've been asking our respiratory care personnel.) In practice, as long as the materials are not wood or cotton, there's a chance you've got something usable. **If you find something that works, please tell us,** along with how you know it works, and we'll post it.

There are several alternatives being tried:

- We are looking into using small urine loops as shafts; we don't yet have a solution for how to apply a swab end. Will post if we do. At least there are usually very many of these around in clinical microbiology laboratories
- Printing a bristled head is a no-go for conventional 3D printers, as the features are too small. It is possible that a sand-blasted/chemically etched/otherwise roughened bulb *might* work, but we are not doing research here: we're looking for our best bet for a sure thing
- Mascara brushes. The consensus so far is, the materials might be right but the brushes are far too large/widely spaced. Again, they *might* work, but see above

BRISTLE W/O ADHESIVES
--------------------------------------
1) knurling process to crush plastic to give it a high-surface area feature (can be done with a vice and rough surface plates;  burnish sharp edges)
2) sanding / sand blasting to roughen edges
3) chemical etching to roughen edges
4) reheating plastic locally and forcing into a mold (need to watch out for brittleness)
5) molding/3D printing shape
 
BRISTLE W/ ADHESIVES
-----------------------------------
1) flocking
2) absorptive foam  (open-cell, like paint-brush)
3) tooth-brush material
4) nylon wool fiber (https://www.polysciences.com/skin/frontend/default/polysciences/pdf/Nylon%20Wool.pdf)
5) panty-hose material (nylon mesh; can be cut and wrapped/wound)
6) synthetic steel wool (https://www.amazon.com/3M-10119NA-Synthetic-Steel-Wool/dp/B00004Z4AE)
