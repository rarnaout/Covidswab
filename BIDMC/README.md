<a name="phase1"></a>
### Phase I testing: expert evaluation, collection sufficiency, PCR compatibility

Earlier this week we completed <a href="../BIDMC/np_swab_results.xlsx">Phase I testing</a> of over 140 materials and prototypes from approximately two dozen manufacturers and other groups.

This phase consists of three steps: (i) expert evaluation, (ii) collection sufficiency (using Gram stain of cheek swab as a proxy for the nasopharynx), (iii) compatibility with our Covid-19 PCR test (we are currently using the Abbott system).

At this point we have completed many iterations with several manufacturers, at each step offering feedback and guidance, working with their engineers, and they have been unbelievably responsive and ingenious in working with us.


<a name="phase2"></a>
### Phase II testing: decontamination, packaging, volume

As we have moved past Phase I, we considered the ability to decontaminate, with a preference for autoclaving; the ability to package singly, and to produce swabs at high volume---hundreds of thousands of units per day or more---and for low cost. This evaluation was done again through many interations with manufacturers.

These two phases resulted in our selection of four prototypes at present---from Carbon3D, EnvisionTEC, Hewlett Packard, and Origin 3D Manufacturing---for Phase III testing, a field trial under IRB (below).

#### How to interpret our selections

To minimize the risk of the kind of supply-chain difficulties that started this crisis, and recognizing that design is difficult and there may be several solutions that work for us, it has been important to us to test different technologies and materials, and this has been a consideration in our selections.

Like everyone, we are constrained by bandwidth and the urgency of this crisis. While we are pleased with the prototypes we are testing, others are free to reach their own conclusions, and specific requirements may differ by setting.

#### Additional prototypes

We announced that we would be testing everything received before 5 p.m. Eastern this past Monday, March 2. Mainly for bandwidth reasons we are discouraging new submissions at BIDMC. Other sites may still be accepting. We will try to facilitate connecting manufacturers with additional testing sites if we are asked.


<a name="phase3"></a>
### Phase III testing: field trial (IRB)

As mentioned above, today we began field testing under an IRB. Briefly we are collecting 10 positives and 10 negatives for control swabs and each prototype and testing concordance. We will make details available in this folder as soon as we can. We may add additional prototypes in the future. We will report results in collaboration with the manufacturers.


<a name="self"></a>
### Self-printing

We have received many inquiries regarding self-printing. We understand there are sites with on-site 3D printing capacity but effectively no swabs for whom this is a particularly urgent issue. While **we strongly encourage waiting to purchase from a manufacturer if at all possible**, we point those in this urgent situation to the work of Summer Decker at USF and of FormLabs, who have <a href="https://usf.box.com/s/wxmlj0r66vp8bzei6o7sur1kq1jr8o1i">graciously made available an STL file and a readme</a>. **Please read the  disclaimers on this repo's main page, and USF's readme, carefully.**


<a name="process"></a>
### Process update

As we move toward what we anticipate will be a successful resolution to this crisis, we understand that competition for credit and contracts will intensify. This is natural. However, **we believe the fastest solution is to remain as collaborative as possible. We encourage manufacturers, and also testing sites, to share as much as they can**. This includes materials testing, protocols, IRBs, and results. 

We can give you a folder and write access to post to the repo, for those who want but do not have it. Meanwhile, please make clear what you do not want shared.

<a name="next"></a>
### Next steps

We anticipate results of our field trial soon, which we hope to share here and on a 5-minute call.



## Friday, March 27, 2020

This entry contains results of testing over the past two days, as manufacturers have iterated their materials and designs, specifically to **combine** tip and shaft geometries that we preferred with preferred materials.

Please see Wednesday's entry (below) for context.

<a name="done"></a>
### What we have done and not done

In total we have tested <a href="np_swab_results.xlsx">over 100 materials and geometries</a>, contributed by over a dozen groups and individuals.

Prototypes mentioned below pass all three of our initial evaluations: <a href="../BIDMC/Methodology.pdf">design evaluation</a>, <a href="../BIDMC/Methodology.pdf">collection sufficiency</a>, and <a href="../BIDMC/Methodology.pdf">PCR compatibility</a>. **This testing does not constitute a clinical trial.**

<a name="trial"></a>
### Clinical trial

**None of the prototypes we have received been field tested** yet at BIDMC. An IRB/trial are in preparation (ceding to USF's WIRB). It is not currently our plan at BIDMC to recommend any swab without such trial.

The below does **not** include evaluation of prototypes received after Thursday afternoon; we are working on those now.

**Note for those with in-house 3D printers:** [USF](/USF) has begun field testing of their self-printed swabs.

<a name="decon"></a>
### Decontamination/sterilization

There is not yet **consensus on sufficient decontamination/sterilization** techniques. Three options are:

- Preferred: autoclaving packaged product
- Backup: ethanol/isopropanol decontamination
- Unknown: vapor-peroxide sterilization

We ask manufacturers of favored designs to tell us what materials are **known to tolerate** these methods, and whether they can be done before delivery.

<a name="package"></a>
### Packaging

Single-swab packaging is preferred.

Discussions on these are ongoing. See also note below.

<a name="schedule"></a>
### Our testing schedule

We will continue to evaluate new swabs **received before 5 p.m. ET on Monday, March 30.**

<a name="guidance"></a>
### Guidance to other institutions

**If you can wait** for results of field-testing trials for the above, which gate large-scale production, we recommend you do so.

**If you cannot wait** and have in-house 3D printing capacity, we recommend you [read the University of South Florida's results](/USF), since they have field-tested in-house printed solutions (I believe from FormLabs).

### Notable performers, all-in-one

<img src="../BIDMC/img/HP/HP_WS.jpg" width=50%><img src="bend_neck_HP_WS.JPG" width=50%>
HP "WS"



The notability here is the material, which has the same stiffness bendability as the previous version but has a smooth finish. It is autoclavable. The shaft is the preferred design. The breakpoint is a bit difficult to break but acceptable. The tip shown is acceptable but not preferred.

<img src="../BIDMC/img/Carbon/C_6.jpg" width=50%><img src="../BIDMC/img/Carbon/C_7.jpg" width=50%>
Carbon "C-6" (left) and Carbon "C-7"

The empty structure collects sufficient specimen. The central spine of the tip provides sufficient rigidity and flexibility. The longer tip provides similar or greater flexibility than the thin neck. The material is not autoclavable but does tolerate alcohol disinfection.

We reiterate that we consider many <a href="#tip">tip designs</a> as passable.

This document summarizes BIDMC's evaluation of dozens of [**geometries**](#geometries) (swab designs) and [**materials**](#materials) ([full data here](np_swab_results.xlsx)), with brief comments on [**decontamination/sterilization** and **packaging**](#decon), [**production volume**](#volume), and [**clinical trials**](#trials).

## Geometries

**Note:** examples shown are not necessarily the preferred material and not necessarily from the manufacturer who created the design. No attribution of credit is made or implied by this listing.

### Tip

Tip should:

- collect sufficient material (see Gram stains below)
- not end in a sharp tip (e.g., spring geometry ends in sharp tip; if tip is connected to support regardless of geometry, result is a sharp tip)
- maximize surface area
- be flexible (more flexible than bic pen)
- restore elastically to straight (even after multiple bending)

<img src="eswab_gram_stain.JPG" height=150><img src="carbon_c2_gram_stain.JPG" height=150>

Reference (left) and passing-quality (right) Gram stains of cheek swabs. Epithelial cells (large faint pink) and (Gram-positive) bacteria (small purple) are clearly seen. Many Gram stains of the prototype NP swabs under evaluation (like the one at right) collected more material than the reference (left), but this should not be interpreted quantitatively (a lot/a little), only qualitatively (yes/no).


<img src="bend_tip.JPG" height=150>

Tip flexibility

#### Preferred tip:

<img src="hexagon_tip.png" width=40%>

Hexagon (Carbon3D)

This was preferred because the hollowness captured a lot of material, while also being reasonably stiff. This was not a strong preference.


#### Also acceptable (no order):

<img src="bristle_tip.png" width=40%>

Bristle (OPT)

<img src="honeydipper_tip.png" width=40%>

Honeydipper (FormLabs)

<img src="cattail_tip.png" width=40%>

Cattail (HP print of ?USF design)


<img src="brush_tip.png" width=40%>

Brush (HP print of ?USF design)


Note none of these are [flocked]("https://github.com/HMS-RIC/Covid19-NP-Swab/#flock"). FDA says flock is **preferred** but **not required**.

### Shaft

#### Preferred shaft:

3mm-diameter tip, 1mm-diameter neck, 2.5mm-dimater handle and \~2mm breakpoint located 7cm from tip-end of swab.

<img src="archetypal_shaft.png" width=100%>

Archetypal (Abiogenix design (?), HP print)


<a name="stlfiles"></a>
### STL files

We do not have all stl files for all designs tested; what we have are [here](/Covidswab/design_files/). If you need one we don't have, please contact its [creator]("np_swab_results.xlsx"). If you have an stl file to share, please email it to ccallah@bidmc.harvard.edu with *STL-FILE_\<identifier>_\<company>* in the subject field.



<a name="materials"></a>
## Materials

### Handling

Key features (best performers in parentheses):

- straight (HP > Carbon3D, FormLabs)
- smooth to the touch (Carbon3D > FormLabs, HP)
- dry (not sticky) (Carbon3D, HP, FormLabs)
- shaft: stiffness comparable to that of the inkholder of a bic pen
- neck and tip: flexible (capable of being bent 180 degrees without breaking, except at the breakopint) (HP, Carbon3D)
- breaks at breakpoint (should be somewhat difficult to do) (HP, FormLabs)
- no dust or other byproduct of printing process


<img src="bend_neck.JPG" height=150>

Neck flexibility

#### Preferred material:

<img src="keysplint_soft_material.png" width=100%>

Keysplint Soft (Carbon3D)



### PCR compatibility

All materials tested so far (as of March 25, 2020) are PCR compatibile (see Excel for any codenames).

**Passed:** OPT, HP ("USF-1"), EnvisionTec (Nilson), FormLabs, Carbon3D, Pavel.

**Pending:** J_1 (Jifei), USF-2, B_1, S_1 (Seriano), EV.

**Not tested (failed clinical testing):** FT

**Not listed here:** materials from compound manufacturing (shaft plus glue plut flock/PDMS)


<a name="decon"></a>
## Decontamination/sterilization and packaging

Autoclaving preferable, isopropanol or 70% ethanol washes with clean packaging acceptable.

Likely process: swabs produced and washed at scale, then:

- (option 1) take to a company with autoclavable paper packaging (e.g. Georgia-Pacific, 3M), or

- (option 2) packaged at manufacturer's site (e.g. EnvisionTec)

<img src="envisiontec_packaging.png" width=70%>

EnvisionTec's packaging



<a name="volume"></a>
## Production volume

To my knowledge EnvisionTec, HP, FormLabs, and Carbon3D all have capacity for producing at least hundreds of thousands per day.


<a name="trials"></a>
## Field testing, safety, market

**Field testing.** Field testing means using swabs on nasopharynx of people with confirmed SARS-CoV-2.

At BIDMC we have tested for appropriateness by (infectious disease/clinical pathologist) expert evaluation, and tested for sufficiency of collection using cheek swab and Gram stain as a surrogate for viral particle collection from nasopharynx. We have **not** field tested.

Field testing requires IRB approval.

To my knowledge Dr. Summer Decker at USF has field-tested at least on non COVID-19-suspected cases. She has an IRB.

I suggest as a first step other clinical sites model after USF's IRB and have their local IRBs cede review to USF as URB of record.

**Safety.** Note swabs are FDA Class-1 exempt devices; "garage testing" not advised.

**Market.** Several tip/shaft/material combinations will likely yield usable products. There will be a competitive market. A/B testing, marketing, contracting, etc. are beyond the scope of this document.
